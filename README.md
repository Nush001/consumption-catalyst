I'm exploring how rising disposable income is changing the way people spend on beauty — especially with trends like Korean Beauty and new personal care categories taking off. I’m trying to figure out if beauty spending grows in step with income, and whether India is hitting a tipping point for a big consumption boom.

This first dashboard provides a comprehensive look into the global Beauty and Personal Care (BPC) industry through a mix of KPIs and visualizations. The key KPIs showcase each country’s BPC market size, GDP per capita, and BPC spend per capita—all of which are dynamic and linked to a year filter. I chose to start the data from 2011, as this marks the beginning of a noticeable shift in India’s BPC landscape. Although India’s GDP began rising steadily post-2014—from around $1,500 to $2,700 today—the most striking observation is the sharp growth in India’s BPC market between 2015 and 2016, when it jumped from $9B to $12B. This made me curious: is rising income encouraging people to spend more on skincare? That’s why I pulled in GDP per capita—to explore the correlation between income growth and consumer behavior in beauty. 

The country comparison visual uses a horizontal bar chart to easily compare GDP per capita, BPC market size, and BPC per capita across countries. This layout makes it visually simple to grasp how far India is ahead or behind others. The geographic bubble map further reinforces this by using bubble sizes to represent the relative size of each country’s BPC market. 

 
Now moving on to the next we have growth rate analysis table for each country , you can see but how many % difference is in BPC market size from the previous along year, Now as you can see there was a drop –12% in 2018 which very unlikey , because India’s beauty market started booming in 2015–2016 because online stores like Nykaa made products easy to buy, and beauty influencers like Shreya Jain and Debasree Banerjee helped popularize affordable makeup brands like Maybelline and Lakmé through YouTube. So yeah while there was a growth what happened In 2018, India’s beauty market dropped by 12% because new GST rules taxed beauty and skincare products at a high 28%, making them costlier. On top of that, people were still spending less after demonetization. And we can see a whopping 76% growth in 2023, In 2023, India’s beauty and personal care (BPC) market grew by 76% due to multiple factors. Affordable, homegrown brands like Mamaearth, Sugar, and Minimalist made skincare and makeup accessible to younger audiences, especially Gen Z and millennials. Social media and influencer marketing turned beauty into a daily ritual, not just a luxury, with trends spreading fast through Instagram, YouTube, and even regional apps like Moj and Josh. COVID-19 changed habits—people focused more on self-care, started shopping online, and became more aware of ingredients and clean beauty. E-commerce platforms like Nykaa and Amazon expanded reach even in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. Importantly, there was also a big shift in how men viewed grooming—brands like Beardo, The Man Company, and Bombay Shaving Company normalized skincare and self-care for men, boosting their market share. Altogether, beauty became more gender-neutral, affordable, digital, and widely accepted across age and location. 
 
the next Viz we have is where we can compare BPC Market size in a time series , we can see that  inidas BPC market in 2024 was 28B $ , now lets compare it with korea which is 17b$ in 2024, India has over 1.4 billion people, but the total money spent on beauty and personal care in 2024 is only $28 billion. That’s not much more than South Korea’s $17 billion, even though Korea has only around 52 million people. This means that Indians spend very little per person on beauty—only about $19 each, while Koreans spend around $318 per person. So even though India’s total market looks big, it’s mostly because of the large population, not because people are spending a lot. This shows that there’s a huge opportunity for growth in India if more people, especially in smaller towns, start buying beauty and skincare products like those in big cities already do. 

So, what we’re looking at here is a bubble chart that maps GDP per capita on the x-axis and Beauty and Personal Care (BPC) spending per capita on the y-axis. Each bubble represents a country, and the size of the bubble reflects the total market size of the BPC industry in that country. 

Now, the key part here is the trend line—this helps us understand what the expected BPC spending per person should be based on how wealthy a country is. 

South Korea and Japan are both above the trend line, which means that they’re spending more than expected on beauty and personal care products for their income levels. It suggests that in these countries, beauty is seen as a higher priority or cultural value. 

On the other hand, India, China, and the United States are below the trend line. This tells us that, despite having higher or growing incomes, these countries are spending less than expected on BPC per person. In India’s case especially, the low spending per capita and massive population highlight a big gap—and a huge potential market if spending behavior changes. 

So overall, the chart gives us a sense of how each market is behaving relative to their economic status and helps us identify untapped potential or overperforming regions where consumer behavior favors beauty-related products more than we'd expect.

This dashboard offers a layered view into how Asia’s beauty market is evolving—focusing on market size, consumer behavior, ingredient preferences, and brand competition. 

Starting with the global map, we see that China leads Asia in overall Beauty & Personal Care (BPC) market size, while India, though smaller, stands out as a fast-emerging force. Together, these two countries represent a massive base of current and future beauty consumers—making Asia the most exciting region for category growth. 

Looking at usage patterns, the bar chart comparing skincare by gender reveals a sharp divide: women are clearly the dominant skincare users, especially in advanced categories like serums and anti-aging creams. Men’s participation is lower, peaking at moisturizer usage, but the data shows early signs of growing engagement. This opens the door for expansion in male grooming and beginner skincare routines. 

The pie chart on ingredients tells a different story—modern, lab-made skincare dominates the Indian market, capturing about two-thirds of the share. While India has deep cultural roots in ayurveda and herbal beauty, only a small portion of consumers currently use these types. Still, the growing interest in natural and organic products suggests there’s white space for hybrid or heritage-modern blends that balance tradition with scientific credibility. 

Finally, the brand comparison chart between Indian and Korean skincare reveals how Korean brands have won the innovation battle in categories like sheet masks and serums, whereas Indian brands are stronger in basics like cleansers and moisturizers. This shows Indian players are holding their ground in mass segments but need to invest in innovation and trend-driven categories to stay competitive—especially with younger consumers. 

In summary, the dashboard provides strong signals that India is at a turning point. Rising incomes, evolving preferences, and global brand influence are all converging. For investors or decision-makers, the implications are clear: the next wave of growth will come from premiumization, male skincare, and smart innovation. Indian brands have a major opportunity—if they can combine local identity with the performance and excitement global consumers now expect.
